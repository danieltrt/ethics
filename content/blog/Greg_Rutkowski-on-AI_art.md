### Fighting against AI generated art 

Greg Rutkowski is a Polish illustrator and digital artist, whose name has been popping up recently in the field of AI
due to the new image generation tools, such as Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, and MidJourney, among others. Users of
these tools have noticed that by including this artist's name in their prompts, the generated images turn out really cool.
Obviously, this is because Greg's illustrations and art are super cool... But how can the AI "mimic" him? Well... it seems
like images of his art have been used to train these image generation tools. So they have learned so associate a particular
style with Greg's name. 

However, Greg is not happy about this. In fact, he has recently participated in a number of events and given interviews to 
raise awareness to the use and impact of AI generated art on artists such as himself. Below we provide links to some of the
interviews he has given, and to articles where he and his art are mentioned.
