### A personal opinion on The Red Hand Files

[*The Red Hand Files*](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/), a personal website created by popular artist Nick Cave, allows his fans to ask him questions of any and all sorts.

Interestingly, in the beggining of this year, a fan from New Zealand reached out to Nick through The Red Hand Files *ASK A QUESTION*
option after having tried to use the popular (and for some, infamous) ChatGPT to generate a song in the style of Nick Cave.

If  you're curious, check out the artist's response to the original question here:

<!-- ### Black Lines brand identity, by & Smith

Black Lines wants it to be as easy to serve a Negroni as it is a pint of lager. The drinks company is seeking to revolutionise the bar experience by serving cocktails by draught with a changing menu of drinks (as well as same favourite stand-bys). A pink grapefruit spritz was served through the summer while a new pear and white tea fizz joins the line-up for winter.

1. ROFL means Rolling on floor laughing.
2. STFU means Shut the *freak* up.
3. LMK means Let me know.
4. ILY means I love you.
5. YOLO means You only live once.
6. SMH means Shaking my head.

The company was previously known as Hingston + Co. but has been given a complete rebrand — including a new logo, tap badges, website and branded material — by London-based design studio & Smith. The new identity is based on the Kandinsky abstract painting, Black Lines, and true to its name, is mostly black and white with a few flashes of colour. According to & Smith, the identity brings together “art and science” and has been brought to life through collaborations with nine illustrators.
