#     Our art piece, ArtWar, presents a contrast between AI-generated art and human-generated art. The use of technology in art has advanced significantly in recent years, with AI capable of producing images, music, and even literature. While AI-generated art may seem impressive, it raises concerns about the value of human creativity in the future.
#     \n
#     Through ArtWar, we aim to provoke viewers to consider the ethical implications of generative AI. Will technology eventually replace human creativity? And if so, what are the potential consequences? These are essential questions to ponder as we move towards an increasingly automated world.

**WARtist** presents a contrast between human- and AI- generated art. The use of technology in art, regardless of its medium (text, images, sound), has advanced significantly in recent years, with AI capable of producing images, music, and even literature. While AI-generated art may seem impressive, it raises concerns about the value of human creativity in the future.  


Through **WARtist**, we aim to provoke viewers to consider the ethical implications of generative AI.  


- Will technology replace human artists? And if so, what are the potential consequences? 

- Is our appreciation of human creativity and of real artists affected by the capabilities of these tools?

- What role does transparency play with regards to AI generated art?

- Should the access to generative AI tools be regulated or free for all?  

These questions represent a drop in the ocean that is the ethical debate surrounding the move towards an increasingly automated world. We urge everyone to think about this earlier rather than later.  

Sincerely,  

Maria, Daniel, and Nikitha.
