#     Our art piece, ArtWar, presents a contrast between AI-generated art and human-generated art. The use of technology in art has advanced significantly in recent years, with AI capable of producing images, music, and even literature. While AI-generated art may seem impressive, it raises concerns about the value of human creativity in the future.
#     \n
#     Through ArtWar, we aim to provoke viewers to consider the ethical implications of generative AI. Will technology eventually replace human creativity? And if so, what are the potential consequences? These are essential questions to ponder as we move towards an increasingly automated world.

**WARtist** presents a contrast between human- and AI- generated art. The use of technology in art, regardless of its medium (text, images, sound), has advanced significantly in recent years, with AI capable of producing images, music, and even literature. While AI-generated art may seem impressive, it raises concerns about the value of human creativity in the future.


Through **WARtist**, we aim to provoke viewers to consider the ethical implications of generative AI. 


- Will technology replace human artists? And if so, what are the potential consequences? 

- Is our appreciation of human creativity and real artists affected by the capabilities of these tools?

- These are essential questions to ponder as we move towards an increasingly automated world.


Sincerely, 

Maria, Daniel, and Nikitha.
