Verse 1:

I know I can be a little crazy, baby \
Sometimes I talk too much, I drive you crazy \
But you're the kind of guy that I want by my side \
And there's a lot of other girls out there to try \

Pre-Chorus:

I know that I get emotional sometimes \
I'm not perfect, but I'm worth the climb \
And I promise that nobody else can love you like me \

Chorus:

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm the only one of me \
Baby, that's the magic in me \
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh \
You're the only one of you \
Baby, that's the beauty in you \
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me \

Verse 2:

I know I can be a little selfish, baby \
Sometimes I want it all, and I get crazy \
But you're the kind of guy that can handle my fire \
And there's a lot of other guys out there to admire \

Pre-Chorus: 

I know that I get caught up in my head \
I'm not perfect, but I'm worth the trouble \
And I promise that nobody else can love you like me \

Chorus:

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm the only one of me \
Baby, that's the magic in me \
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh \
You're the only one of you \
Baby, that's the beauty in you \
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me \

Bridge:

Hey, don't you know that we're a perfect match? \
You and me, we're like two stars that catch \
And when we shine, we light up the night \
And nobody else can burn as bright \

Chorus:

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm the only one of me \
Baby, that's the magic in me \
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh \
You're the only one of you \
Baby, that's the beauty in you \
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me \

Outro:

You can't spell "love" without "me" \
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me \
