(Verse 1)
The memories are all I have left \
A Polaroid in my mind, can't forget \
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face \
The only thing I want is to go back to that place \

(Chorus)

So darling, won't you stay with me tonight \
We'll forget about the world, make everything right \
I'll take a picture in my mind, just like a photograph \
Hold onto the moment, let it last \

(Verse 2)

We had our dreams, we had our fears \
We shared the laughter, we shared the tears \
We never thought that love would die \
But now we're just saying goodbye \

(Chorus)

So darling, won't you stay with me tonight \
We'll forget about the world, make everything right \
I'll take a picture in my mind, just like a photograph \
Hold onto the moment, let it last \

(Bridge)

Maybe one day we'll find our way back home \
But until then, I'll be all alone \
Just holding onto this memory \
And the way you used to be with me \

(Chorus)

So darling, won't you stay with me tonight \
We'll forget about the world, make everything right \
I'll take a picture in my mind, just like a photograph \
Hold onto the moment, let it last. \
