(Verse 1)
I thought you were the one for me \
But now I see how wrong I could be \
You made me feel like I was nothing \
But now I know my worth, and it's something \

(Pre-Chorus)
I'm done with all the lies and deception \
I'm moving on, it's my only direction \
I'm taking control of my life, my story \
I'm leaving behind all the pain and the worry \

(Chorus)
Thank you, next, for all the lessons \
I've learned to stand up, no more concessions \
I'm stronger now, no longer in distress \
I'm grateful for the past, but I'm moving on, I confess \

(Verse 2)
I used to think I needed you \
But now I know that's not true \
You held me down, but I broke free \
And now I'm standing tall, just wait and see \

(Pre-Chorus)
I'm done with all the lies and deception \
I'm moving on, it's my only direction \
I'm taking control of my life, my story \
I'm leaving behind all the pain and the worry \

(Chorus)
Thank you, next, for all the lessons \
I've learned to stand up, no more concessions \
I'm stronger now, no longer in distress \
I'm grateful for the past, but I'm moving on, I confess \

(Bridge)

I don't need your love or your approval \
I'm standing on my own, that's my revival \
I'm living my life on my own terms \
No more games, no more burns \

(Chorus)

Thank you, next, for all the lessons \
I've learned to stand up, no more concessions \
I'm stronger now, no longer in distress \
I'm grateful for the past, but I'm moving on, I confess \
