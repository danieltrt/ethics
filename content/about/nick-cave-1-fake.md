**Full Song Generated:** 
Verse 1: 

In the depths of the night, I hear a call \ 
A voice that echoes, through the hall  \
It’s a siren’s song, that pulls me in  \
Takes me to a place, where I can’t begin  \

Chorus: 

I am the sinner, I am the saint  \
I am the darkness, I am the light \ 
I am the hunter, I am the prey  \
I am the devil, I am the savior  \

Verse 2: 

I walk the streets, with my head held high  \
I’ve got my demons, but I’ll make them fly  \
I’ll dance with the devil, and I’ll play his game \ 
I’ll be the one, to call his name  \

Chorus: 

I am the sinner, I am the saint  \
I am the darkness, I am the light \ 
I am the hunter, I am the prey  \
I am the devil, I am the savior  \

Bridge: 

I’ve got the blood of angels, on my hands \ 
I’ve got the fire of hell, in my eyes  \
I’m the king of the abyss, I’m the ruler of the dark  \
I’m the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark  \

Chorus: 

I am the sinner, I am the saint  \
I am the darkness, I am the light \ 
I am the hunter, I am the prey  \
I am the devil, I am the savior  \

Outro: 

So come with me, to the edge of the night \
Where the darkness and the light collide  \
We’ll walk the line, between the good and the bad \ 
And we’ll see, who comes out on top in the end. \
